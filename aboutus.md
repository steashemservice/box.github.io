    <li>Sujatha who loves healthy eating and sustainability</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our everyday food choices affect global warming and the environment. One-third of our greenhouse gas emissions come from food, but it's also the easy part to affect. India has the most vegetarians in the world. Indians eat seldom meat and live eating vegetarian food several days a week. Indian food is nutritious, flavourful, healthy, but also good for the climate. We started Indiska Boxen to bring climate-smart Indian food to swedish homes and at same time convey how nutritious and tasty it can be to eat climate-smart.</p> <p>One-third of all food produced goes to waste and freezing food can help reduce food waste. We save our 1/3 by freezing in freshly cooked food. We select our dishes carefully, all our dishes are made in eco-friendly one-pot and wholesome food. Our food comes in recyclable eco-friendly bambu boxes with plastic lid.
