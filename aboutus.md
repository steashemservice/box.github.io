  <p>Two IT engineers from Sundbyberg in Stockholm who love food:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Dilip loves to cook Indian food</li>
  <li>Sujatha loves sustainable consumption and healthy eating</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
Then we got married, Indiska Boxen was born. 
Why Indiska Boxen? We want to bring climate-smart Indian food and at same time convey how tasty it can be to eat. One third of the climate impact come from food and food is also the most easy part to affect.
India has the most vegetarians in the world. Indians live eating vegetarian food several days a week, which are tasty and healthy, but also good for the climate. Frozen food helps to reduce climate impact from food waste by freezing in freshly prepared food immediately after they are cooked. Zero waste.
Frozen Indian food is the best combination we can give to Mother Earth and to our own health.
