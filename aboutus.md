  <p>Two IT engineers from Sundbyberg in Stockholm who love food:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Dilip loves to cook Indian food</li>
  <li>Sujatha loves sustainability and health issues</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
Then we got married, Indiska Boxen was born. 
Why Indiska Boxen? We want to convey how tasty it can be to eat climate-smart Indian food. One third of the climate impact come from the food and the food is also the most easy to affect.
India have most vegetarians in the world. Indians eat vegetarian food several days a week, which is tasty and healthy, but also good for the climate. Frozen food helps to reduce climate impact by freezing in all food directly after cooking. Zero waste.
Frozen Indian food is the best combination we can give to Mother Earth and to our own health.
