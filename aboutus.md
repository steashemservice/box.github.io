      <h2>Mission</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Our everyday food choices affect global warming and the environment. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local">One-fourth of our greenhouse gas emissions come from food</a>, but it's also the easy part to affect. <a href="https://www.wwf.se/mat-och-jordbruk/vad-ska-jag-ata">One-third of all food produced goes to waste</a> and freezing food can help reduce food waste. At Indiska Boxen, we strive to make an immediate impact towards the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change">UN SDG 2030</a> goal through <a href="https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet-commission">portion packed frozen Indian food</a>.</p>

	  <p>We started Indiska Boxen to bring climate-smart Indian food to swedish homes and at same time convey how nutritious and tasty it can be to eat climate-smart. Indian food is nutritious, flavourful, healthy, but also good for the climate. We select our dishes carefully, all our dishes are made in eco-friendly one-pot and wholesome food. Our food comes in recyclable eco-friendly bambu boxes.</p>
